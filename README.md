Gender Estimation Using Machine Learning and the VGG-16 Model

This project predicts a person's gender from an image of their face using a pre-trained VGG-16 model. It applies this method to three popular facial datasets: CelebA, FairFace, and Adience. Due to hardware limitations, only a subset of 2,650 images was used in the training and evaluation process.
